			<p>It's possible to play a patch live, just like you might play
				an instrument live on stage. While something is running in the
				patch, you can click on GUI objects, though using the mouse is
				fairly impractical if you want be precise with respect to time. For
				this reason, there are Human Interface Devices (HIDs), interfaces
				between man and machine. The mouse and keyboard are technically
				HIDs, but there are also many others, some of which are specially
				designed for use in music, for example to control a Pd patch.</p>

				<p>If you click in a number box, you can enter a value with the
					keyboard. You could also use the keyboard to transmit other
					information directly:</p>
				<div class="informalfigure">

						<img src="images/kap4/4-3-1a.jpg">
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>The keys are numbered (with some exceptions, the F1 and F12
					keys, for example). "key" registers that a key has been pressed,
					"keyup" that it has been released. Each time, the key's number is
					sent. "keyname" shows a key's normal name.</p>
				<p>Using the "MouseState" (case-sensitive!) external from
					Pd-extended, you can also use data from the mouse:</p>
				<div class="informalfigure">

				</div>
				<p>With "poll" and "unpoll" you can start/stop the display (in
					my version you have to click "unpoll" first and then "poll" for it
					to work). This displays absolute x/y-coordinates, delta values, and
					also whether the left mouse button is held.</p>
				<p>Normally the coordinates 0/0 appear in the monitor's upper
					left; with "zero" you can select another point as a reference:</p>

							</h4>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>At the beginning of the 80s, large electronic instrument
					manufacturers established a standard data transfer protocol for use
					with an array of input devices called Musical Instrument Digital
					Interface (MIDI). Now there are MIDI keyboards, MIDI mixers, MIDI
					gloves, etc. In Pd, there are objects for receiving and sending
					MIDI data. You can send this input to a device or patch where it is
					converted into sound. However, most computer soundcards contain
					MIDI sounds as well, so MIDI data can also be converted into sound
					there.</p>
				<p>MIDI protocol itself doesn't contain any sounds, but
					comprises commands for controlling the patch or other instruments,
					e.g., "note-on", "velocity", and "note-off". In addition to these
					basic commands MIDI uses other more specialized commands that could
					be used to, say, load other sounds or to modify loaded sounds using
					control data produced using switches, buttons, or tuning knobs.</p>
				<p>
					Every standard MIDI command (except for system-exclusive data,
					SysEx for short) carries a channel number in addition to its
					command ID and command data. The channel number is 4 bits long,
					which means 2<sup>4</sup>=16 channels can be controlled. Depending
					on the software, the channels are numbered either 0 to 15 or 1 to
					16, though the latter is more common.
				</p>
				<p>Since MIDI is a serialized protocol and the data rate of MIDI
					interfaces is fairly small by today's standards, there can often be
					timing problems when many notes are played at once, especially in
					conjunction with a sequencer program. Even just striking a chord
					comprising several notes can lead to an audible delay, because MIDI
					can never send notes simultaneously, only one at a time.</p>
				<p>
					For the following examples, MIDI hardware is necessary. You can set
					these devices in Pd under <span class="strong"><strong>Media</strong></span>
					<span class="strong"><strong>MIDI settings</strong></span>.
				</p>
				<p>The most basic object is "midiin". Every MIDI input is
					displayed there, the value on the left and the channel number on
					the right.</p>
				<div class="informalfigure">
					<div class="mediaobject">
						<img src="images/kap4/4-3-1d.jpg">
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>If you have a MIDI keyboard or other input device with
					definite pitches, with "notein" you get the following values:</p>
				<div class="informalfigure">
					<div class="mediaobject">
						<img src="images/kap4/4-3-1e.jpg">
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>The MIDI number for the pitch appears on the left, the
					velocity (strength of the attack) in the middle, and the channel
					number on the right.</p>
				<p>Conversely, you could send this information to an instrument.
					If only one instrument is connected, you don't have to enter a
					channel number. You'll need to use "noteout" and then "makenote",
					the latter of which combines the entries in a manner similar to the
					"pack" object:</p>
				<div class="informalfigure">
					<div class="mediaobject">
						<img src="images/kap4/4-3-1f.jpg">
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>There are also control values, which are entered with "ctlin"
					and "ctlout". Let's take a look at "ctlin":</p>
				<div class="informalfigure">
					<div class="mediaobject">
						<img src="images/kap4/4-3-1g.jpg">
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>The left output is the value, the middle the number of the
					controller, and the channel on the right. You could also enter the
					middle value as an argument directly in the object to select the
					controller.</p>
				<p>All other MIDI senders and receivers function like this as
					well. Among them are "pgmin", "bendin", "touchin", and "sysexin".</p>

					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					Sound input received through a microphone can not only be used
					purely as sound, but also as control data. As you learned in <a
						class="link" href="ch03s08.html#chapt3.8.3.1"
						title="3.8.3.1 fiddle~">3.8.3.1</a>, you can use "fiddle~" to
					determine information regarding amplitude and frequency:
				</p>
				<div class="informalfigure">
					<div class="mediaobject">
						<img src="images/kap4/4-3-1h.jpg">
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>These numbers &#8211; again, Pure Data works only with
					numbers &#8211; can be used in conjunction with parameters in a
					patch.</p>
				<p>One problem here is that data that comes from the "fiddle~"
					object is very chaotic. There is a trick you can use to filter it:</p>
				<div class="informalfigure">
					<div class="mediaobject">
						<img src="images/kap4/4-3-1i.jpg">
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>A low-pass filter can also receive control data input. In
					this case, only relatively slow changes are allowed to pass.</p>

				</div>
				<p>It's clear that different devices have different functions: a
					button stands for on/off, a knob for gradual changes.</p>
				<p>For controllers that have a row of numbers, like knobs or
					sliders, it is recommended that you use interpolation (especially
					because they have only 128 values in MIDI).</p>
				<p>In Pd-extended (but only if GEM isn't loaded), there is a
					very useful external you can use for this: "scale". For example, if
					you change frequencies between 69 and 81 (MIDI numbers) and want to
					use a MIDI controller for this (which generates numbers from 0 to
					127), you could write:</p>
				<div class="informalfigure">
					<div class="mediaobject">

				<p>The last argument stands for linear (0) or exponential (1).</p>

				<p>In addition to the normal keyboard, mouse, and MIDI devices,
					the number of other input devices continues to rise: anything from
					joysticks for computer games, to tablets for drawing, to motion
					sensors. Though there is at present (June 2008) no single object in
					Pd that will work with all of these devices, the following
					externals should be mentioned:</p>
				<p>"joystick", which can receive information from joysticks;
					"wintablet" for Wacom tablets in Windows; and "hid" in Linux and
					MacOSX, which works with many different input devices. A device
					called an Arduino Board has also been around for awhile; this
					device digitizes information it receives from analog instruments
					that are connected to it. With additional software, this
					information can also be received by Pd.</p>
