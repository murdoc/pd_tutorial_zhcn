		<p>Readers of this book should have Pd installed on their computer
			so they are able to try out the processes described. Without this
			simultaneous practical experience, this tutorial will be difficult to
			understand.</p>
		<p>First you need a computer with at least 128 MB main memory, a
			500 MHz processor and ca. 500 MB hard disk space (these are the
			absolute minimum requirements!). Pd works with the following
			operating systems: Linux, OS X, and Windows.</p>
		<p>Then you need to download the newest version of Pd-extended
			from the Internet. Enter "Pd-extended" into an Internet search
			engine. Since the address for the download portal may change in the
			future, no link to the site will be provided here. Pd-extended is a
			version of the original software (also called "Pd vanilla") that has
			been expanded with numerous libraries. Most of the exercises
			described here work with the original version of Pd, but not all of
			them. The extra objects in Pd-extended make the program much more
			practical in general. This tutorial assumes Pd-extended version 0.39
			or higher.</p>
		<p>
			Once Pd has been installed, we open it from the directory Pd/bin/. A
			window appears. This is the main control center, so to speak. Here
			you can test whether Pd is functioning properly: In the main menu,
			click on <span class="strong"><strong>Media</strong></span> <span
				class="strong"><strong>Test Audio and MIDI</strong></span>. Under
			"TEST SIGNAL", click first on the box next to "&#8211;40", then on
			the box next to "&#8211;20". You should hear a sine tone coming out
			of the computer's loudspeaker (A4). If you do not, then you need to
			adjust your hardware settings (under <span class="strong"><strong>Media</strong></span>
			<span class="strong"><strong>Audio settings</strong></span>). More
			information regarding problems that arise at this stage cannot be
			given here. For help resolving any problems, please consult the
			"Pd-list", a forum of Pd users on the Internet. If a microphone is
			connected, the digits in at least the leftmost two boxes under "AUDIO
			INPUT" should change in response to sound picked up by the
			microphone. As long as the test tone is working, you can work with
			the program without a microphone. (By Chapter 3 at the latest,
			however, you will sometimes need a microphone.)
