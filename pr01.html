		<p>This book is the result of my experience of teaching electronic
			music. Through the teaching process, I became familiar with the most
			common stumbling blocks students encounter &#8212; especially when
			the student's native language is not the language in which lessons
			are conducted.</p>
		<p>
			Pd (Pure Data) is a professional, high-performance programming
			language for electronic sound processing. It is <span
				class="emphasis"><em>open source</em></span>, i.e. available for
			free on the Internet. One disadvantage of this is that Pd is only
			discussed in certain institutions or Internet forums. The complicated
			technical terminology usually found there is enormously difficult for
			beginners to understand. This book will help first-time users to
			clear those first few hurdles when learning Pd.
		</p>
		<p>Pd's main designer, Miller Puckette, is also writing a book
			about the theory and technology of electronic music processing with
			Pd. Surely there is no better teacher of a programming language than
			the person who designed it; his primarily scientific approach
			certainly does cover all the material in a thorough, systematic
			fashion. However, his method of teaching can be difficult to
			comprehend. My pedagogical experience has been that Puckette's text
			demands a large amount of mathematical, computer science, and
			terminological knowledge from its readers.</p>
		<p>This book is designed for self-study, principally for
			composers. It begins with explanations of basic programming and
			acoustic principles before gradually building up to the most advanced
			electronic music processing techniques. Some knowledge of physics is
			assumed and explanations of basic physics concepts have been
			intentionally omitted. My book's teaching approach is focused
			primarily on hearing, which I regard as a faster and more enjoyable
			way to absorb new concepts than through abstract formulas. In terms
			of mathematics, I explain only what is absolutely necessary to
			comprehend a given processing concept. I explain the various
			techniques from a compositional perspective, rather than attempting a
			computer science-, math-, or physics-based discussion of processing
			phenomena or structures. Therefore, the decisions and comments I have
			made are purely subjective and are open to debate.</p>
		<p>This book would not have been possible without the support of
			Prof. Mathias Spahlinger, the expert supervision of Prof. Orm
			Finnendahl, suggestions and patches from the Pd community, the
			manuscript editing and DocBook-XML coding efforts of Esther Kochte. I
			would also like to thank Mark Barden for the English translation and
			the Musikhochschule Freiburg and the state of Baden-Württemberg for
			financing the project, which &#8212; in the spirit of the open source
			movement &#8212; makes it possible for all interested parties to use
			this book for free on the Internet. This will hopefully increase
			interest in electronic music, thereby indirectly enriching the
			aesthetic discourse of New Music.</p>
