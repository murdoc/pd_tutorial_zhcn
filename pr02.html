The first steps are therefore described in meticulous detail.</p><p>Pd can run on different platforms (like Linux, OS X, or Windows) and this book is not platform-specific. Problems relating to the operating system will not be discussed, as they are simply beyond the scope of this tutorial (and it is also quite likely that changes &#8212; updates, bug fixes, etc. &#8212; will occur in the near future). It is therefore assumed that Pd has been correctly installed and has been integrated with the hardware environment (consult an Internet forum to resolve any of these sorts of problems, e.g. "Pd-list").</p><p>How to use this book: Each lesson is comprised of a theory part, a practice part and an appendix, as well as individual aspects that are explained in greater detail at the end of each section. This in-depth information is aimed at advanced users and is not essential to acquire a basic working knowledge of Pd. I recommend working through the whole book without consulting these additional details first, then going back to learn them later.</p><p>Now and again, some fundamental concepts of acoustics are discussed. The exercises contain not only specific compositional questions, but also applications that are useful for musicians' everyday needs &#8212; e.g. tools like the metronome or tuning device. In this respect, the tutorial could be used by interpreters as well as composers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><hr></div><div class="navfooter"></p> <p><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="pr01.html"><img src="images/prev.png" width="41" height="20" title="previous" alt="Prev"></a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="p" href="ch01.html"><img src="images/next.png" width="41" height="20" title="next" alt="Next"></a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Preface </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 1. Introduction to Pd</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
