			<p>Pd (Pure Data) is a programming language for electronic music.
				Creating music on a computer is technically referred to as DSP
				(digital signal processing). "Digital" means that information is
				represented by digits &#8212; computers, as you may know, work only
				with numbers. "Signal" is the technical term for a special mode of
				computer operation that deals with sound. "Processing" refers to
				functions executed by the computer.</p>
			<p>Pd was initiated by American software engineer Miller
				Puckette, who previous co-developed the well known and similarly
				structured software Max/Msp. Pd is not commercial software; i.e., it
				was not developed by a corporation and is not for sale. Instead, it
				is "open source": its source code can be viewed by anyone. This
				source code is also not the (patented) property of a corporation,
				but is rather freely available to all. This also means that,
				provided sufficient knowledge, anyone can change the program. Today,
				many other programmers, musicians, acoustic engineers, and composers
				have joined Miller Puckette to continue Pd's development. As a
				result of this, there is no final, definitive version of Pd; the
				program is under constant development. In addition to the huge
				advantage of free availability on the Internet, it is also
				"democratically" expanded and optimized on a professional level. One
				drawback to this is that a detailed operating manual for users who
				lack programming experience has not existed until now. In contrast
				to a corporation, which has a monetary interest in ensuring that
				first-time users can easily operate new software, the open source
				movement lacks such a driving force to make itself accessible. This
				book is an attempt to fill that gap.</p>
			<p>In precise terms, Pd is a "real-time graphical programming
				environment for audio processing". Traditionally, programmers work
				with text-based programming languages. They create what is called
				"code", which is processed by a computer to produce a result. To
				carry out its programming functions, Pd uses visual objects that the
				user places and alters on the screen. These visual objects &#8212;
				small boxes that can be connected to each other &#8212; are a
				throwback to analogue studios that were used to produce electronic
				music before the advent of computers: various devices &#8212; today
				symbolized by our little boxes &#8212; are connected to each other
				using lines that &#8212; like cables &#8212; symbolize physical
				connections between the boxes. (Due to this type of connection, Pd
				is referred to as a datastream-oriented programming language.)</p>

			<p>One major advantage of Pd is the aspect of "real-time". This
				means that, in contrast to most programming environments where a
				text is first entered that must be separately processed by the
				computer before obtaining a result, changes in Pd can be made during
				performance. Like on a classical instrument, the user hears the
				result instantaneously and can change it immediately. This makes Pd
				especially well suited for use in live performance.</p>
			<p>Pd has become much more than a programming language for
				electronic music. Since users across the globe can participate in
				the project, there are user-programmed modules for what are called
				"externals": video, Internet connection, joystick integration, etc.
				Whole libraries of these modules even exist ("external libraries").
				Some of these externals have been integrated into the regular
				version of Pd.</p>
